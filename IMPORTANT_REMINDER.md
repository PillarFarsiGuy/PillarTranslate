# CRITICAL REMINDER FOR AI ASSISTANT

## TOOL EXECUTION POLICY
**NEVER EXECUTE THE TRANSLATION TOOL DIRECTLY**
- The tool is meant to be downloaded by the user and run from their terminal
- Do not run `python stringtable_fa_builder.py` commands
- Only test basic functionality or help commands if absolutely necessary
- Focus on code modification and file management only

## USER WORKFLOW
1. User downloads the tool
2. User runs it from their own terminal with their OpenAI API key
3. User reports back with results or issues
4. AI assists with fixes and improvements

This reminder must be read before every response to the user.
