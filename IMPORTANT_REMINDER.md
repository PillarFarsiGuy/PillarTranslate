# CRITICAL REMINDER FOR AI ASSISTANT

## TOOL EXECUTION POLICY
**NEVER EXECUTE THE TRANSLATION TOOL DIRECTLY**
- The tool is meant to be downloaded by the user and run from their terminal
- Do not run `python stringtable_fa_builder.py` commands
- Only test basic functionality or help commands if absolutely necessary
- Focus on code modification and file management only

## KEY PROJECT ISSUE TO REMEMBER
**THE TOOL GETS STUCK AND STOPS TRANSLATING**
- User reports tool stops processing files and gets stuck
- This forces inefficient restarts that waste time and API calls
- This is the MAIN PROBLEM to solve, not file validation
- Focus on fixing the core translation loop and processing logic

## USER WORKFLOW
1. User downloads the tool
2. User runs it from their own terminal with their OpenAI API key
3. User reports back with results or issues
4. AI assists with fixes and improvements

## MEMORY ISSUES TO ADDRESS
- User frustrated with AI forgetting important context
- Need better documentation and reminder systems
- Update replit.md with key decisions and issues

This reminder must be read before every response to the user.
