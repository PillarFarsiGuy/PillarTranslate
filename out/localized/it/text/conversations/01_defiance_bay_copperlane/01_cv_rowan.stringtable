He sizes you up. "New in town, eh? You've picked an interesting time to visit Defiance Bay. All these refugees fleeing the frontier and finding the Legacy's no better here."

"It's the animancers, Magran scorch 'em, and they nest in this city like rats.

He points to a long, domed building west and north of your position. "And that's the Hall of Revealed Mysteries.
