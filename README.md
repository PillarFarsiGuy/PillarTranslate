# Pillars of Eternity Farsi Translation Tool

Help me acutally make this translation into a workable mod if you are interested in playing pillars of eternity in Farsi. I thought that this is a popular and beloved rpg game which: 1. might make a really useful language learning tool for peopel who have already played the game a million times like me. 2. Will open up a door of a classic in the RPG genre to an extremly underserved language group.

GO TO "out" to access the fully transalted game files


Everything else is an AI generated tool made by Replit to translate said file using an openAI API key.
The whole process costs about 18$ but I do not recommend running it yourself. The tool is now useless because the files are translated.
I am only uploading the rest of the tool in case anyone out there can use it to translate other games. I am done with it.
Also, it does not work without a LOT of editing live. The large majority of this code is AI generated and I have no idea how it works. Amazing what we can do now huh? I'm a history major and I have no idea how to use a computer beyond outside of Jstor and google docs. Theres a lot of usless junk in this code left over from me fenagling with it.
